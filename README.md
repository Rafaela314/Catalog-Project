# Project 3: Item Catalog
###
Item Catalog project, part of the Udacity [Full Stack Web Developer
Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). 

## What it is and does
This is  RESTful web application utilizing the Flask framework which accesses a SQL database that populates categories and their items. OAuth2 provides authentication for further CRUD functionality on the application. Currently OAuth2 is implemented for Google Accounts.

It runs a website that stores details of house furnitures(items and catrgories). The user can login via Google or Facebook in order to add their own items.

## Required Libraries and Dependencies
The project code requires the following software:

* Python 2.7.x
* [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) 0.8.4 or higher (a Python SQL toolkit)
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) 0.10.1 or higher (a web development microframework)
* The following Python packages:
    * oauth2client
    * requests
    * httplib2
    * flask-seasurf (a CSRF defence)


You can run the project in a Vagrant managed virtual machine (VM) which includes all the
required dependencies (see below for how to run the VM). For this you will need
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) and
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) software installed on your
system.

## Project contents
This project consists for the following files in the `catalog` directory:

* `Catalog.py` - The main Python script that serves the website. If no database
    is found, one is created and populated by `populate_database.py`.
* `fb_client_secrets.json` - Client secrets for Facebook OAuth login.
* `client_secrets.json` - Client secrets for Google OAuth login.
* `README.md` - This read me file.
    * `/static` - Directory containing CSS and Javascript for the website.
       
    * `/templates` - Directory containing the HTML templates for the website.
  

## How to Run the Project
Download the project zip file to you computer and unzip the file. Or clone this
repository to your desktop.

Open the text-based interface for your operating system (e.g. the terminal
window in Linux, the command prompt in Windows).

Navigate to the project directory and then enter the `vagrant` directory.

### Bringing the VM up
Bring up the VM with the following command:

```bash
vagrant up
```

The first time you run this command it will take awhile, as the VM image needs to
be downloaded.

You can then log into the VM with the following command:

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

More detailed instructions for installing the Vagrant VM can be found
[here](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud197/install-vagrant).

### Make sure you're in the right place
Once inside the VM, navigate to the tournament directory with this command:

```bash
cd /vagrant/catalog
```

### OAuth setup
In order to log in to the web app, you will need to get either a Google+ or Facebook
(or both) OAuth app ID and secret. For Google, go to the
[Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and for Facebook,
go to [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/products/login).

Once you have your credentials, put the IDs and secrets in the `fb_client_secrets.json`
file for Facebook and `client_secrets.json` for Google.

You will now be able to log in to the app.

### Run application.py
On the first run of `application.py` there will be no database present, so it creates
one and populates it with sample data. On the command line do:

```bash
python application.py
```

It then starts a web server that serves the application. To view the application,
go to the following address using a browser on the host system:

```
http://localhost:8000/
```

You should see the 10 latest animals that were added to the database. Go ahead and
explore the web site. To add an animal, you'll need to log in first with either a
Google or Facebook account.


### Shutting the VM down
When you are finished with the VM, press `Ctrl-D` to logout of it and shut it down
with this command:

```bash
vagrant halt
```

## Extra Credit Description
The following features are present to earn an extra credit from Udacity.

### XML Endpoint
Database contents can be obtained in XML form by going to
[http://localhost:8000/catalog.xml](http://localhost:5000/catalog.xml). Depending
on your browser, you may need to view source of the page to view the XML file. You
can do this by right-clicking and selecting `View Page Source` from the menu.
